# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a playful, baby-themed comedic animation sequence to the Login page while keeping the existing login form fully functional, readable, and primary.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a dedicated baby-themed animation section on the Login page that visually conveys laughter, moving/running, and kissing/hearts without blocking the form.
- Implement the animation elements using Framer Motion with consistent 0.5s transition timing for entrances and key motion beats.
- Ensure the animation is responsive across mobile and desktop and does not cause layout shift that hides or disrupts the login form.
- Add and reference required generated static visual assets from `frontend/public/assets/generated` via static paths (no backend/remote hosting).

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a clearly visible, comedic baby-themed animated sequence on the Login page (laughter + running motion + hearts/kissing) while the login form continues to work exactly as before without interference.
