      "requirement": "Implement the Login page baby-themed animation using Framer Motion with consistent 0.5s transition timing for entrance and key motion beats, and ensure it is responsive.",
      "reason": "The new animation component is plain JSX with CSS classnames (no `framer-motion` imports/`motion.*` elements). A new utils file explicitly states the app uses CSS animations instead of Framer Motion, which conflicts with the requirement. Responsiveness is partially suggested via Tailwind `sm:` classes, but Framer Motion usage and 0.5s Framer Motion transitions are not implemented.",
