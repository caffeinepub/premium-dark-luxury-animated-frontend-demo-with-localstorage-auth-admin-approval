  "summary": "The diff adds a new React entry module (frontend/src/main.authz.tsx) that wraps <App /> with AuthzProvider (alongside QueryClientProvider and InternetIdentityProvider) and updates frontend/index.html to load this new entry file. No evidence in the diff indicates changes to frontend/src/App.tsx or the immutable frontend/src/main.tsx. However, the diff also introduces unrelated visual/UX changes in index.html (critical CSS) and modifies project_state.json, neither of which were requested.",

    {
      "description": "Added/changed critical inline CSS in index.html to prevent white flash on load (background/color styling). This is a visual/design change not requested and is listed as a non-goal.",
