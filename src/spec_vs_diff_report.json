  "summary": "The diff does not implement Firebase initialization or Firebase Auth email/password login. `frontend/src/firebase.ts` still exports `auth`/`db` as null placeholders, and `LoginPage.tsx` still authenticates against localStorage via `getUser(email)` and `user.password !== password`. LocalStorage seeding/credential checks are not removed or bypassed.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-63",
      "requirement": "Replace the placeholder Firebase module with real Firebase initialization using the exact provided firebaseConfig, and export working Firebase instances (at minimum `auth` and `db`) instead of null placeholders.",
      "reason": "`frontend/src/firebase.ts` still exports `db = null` and `auth = null` and does not show any Firebase SDK initialization (e.g., initializeApp/getAuth/getFirestore).",

      "reason": "Login logic still uses localStorage lookup (`getUser(email)`) and compares plaintext password (`user.password !== password`), with no Firebase Auth sign-in call present in the shown changes.",

      "id": "REQ-65",
      "requirement": "Remove or bypass any localStorage-only admin seeding and/or localStorage credential checks that can interfere with Firebase admin login diagnostics, ensuring Firebase Auth alone determines authentication success/failure.",
      "reason": "The login flow still relies on localStorage credential checks (`getUser` + password comparison), which means localStorage-seeded users can still determine authentication outcomes. No diff evidence shows removing/bypassing seeding or localStorage credential checks.",

    {
      "description": "Modified `frontend-file-summaries.txt` and `project_state.json` (project metadata/summaries) without any explicit request to update project documentation/state files as part of the login fix.",
