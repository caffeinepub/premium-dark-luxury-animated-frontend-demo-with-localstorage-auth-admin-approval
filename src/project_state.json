  "summary": "Project scope is to keep the existing Firebase Authentication + Firestore backend and update the app to be fully Firestore-driven for authorization: admin detection uses Firestore user.role (no predefined admin email/password checks), and approval/page access use Firestore fields approved:boolean and allowedPages:string[]. After Firebase Auth login, fetch the user doc and store role/approved/allowedPages in application state (not localStorage) to drive dynamic navigation visibility and route guards with safe redirects. Firestore Security Rules are the primary enforcement for admin-only writes (user management/global content), with client-side checks only for UI/route protection; keep the UI layout unchanged and avoid unnecessary architectural changes.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Use React Router for routes and route protection; redirect unauthenticated to /login; restrict /admin to admin role.",
    "Use Framer Motion for consistent 0.5s transitions, hover states, and route/page animations.",
    "Maintain modular structure: src/, components/, pages/, utils/ with consistent UI styling.",
    "Navbar should be rendered on the /admin page as well (consistent sticky glassmorphism styling + Framer Motion animations across authenticated pages).",
    "Do not render the main Navbar on unauthenticated pages (Login/Register); show Navbar only on authenticated user/admin areas.",
    "Registration should be launched from Login as a modal popup and include confirm-password validation; after registration, return user to Login screen.",
    "Project now requires a proper backend + database to support admin-controlled content, file uploads, enable/disable visibility controls, and consistent deployed behavior (not localStorage/static-only).",
    "Production deployment must ensure correct asset paths/build config so CSS/JS/resources load consistently outside the dev platform across browsers/devices.",
    "For any protected/restricted route access while unauthenticated, redirect to /login while preserving the originally requested path (and optional query/hash) so post-login can automatically navigate back to that destination.",
    "Use Firebase Authentication + Firestore (no Motoko backend): each user doc includes approved:boolean and allowedPages:string[]; on login and on full page refresh re-fetch the user doc (no real-time listeners), build navigation from allowedPages, and guard routes by redirecting unauthorized users to a safe page."
